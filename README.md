XABE - Xawksows Automated Build Environment
====

<strong>What is this?</strong><br />
Its a build environment for coins which are based on Bitcoin Core 0.9.3.

<strong>How to use it?</strong><br />
Start 64msys.bat for building a 64bit wallet or 32msys.bat for a 32bit wallet.<br />
If you've started it, press 4. and enter your coins github address. <br />
After that press 1. and you just need to wait, everything will be build automatically.<br />
If you want to build a 32bit wallet after building a 64bit wallet or the other way around, <br />
you need to be sure to select clean in the build menu before building again.<br />
